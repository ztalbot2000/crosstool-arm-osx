#  Changes
#    3/11/18 - Updated to use crosstool-ng v1.23
#    3/12/18 - You can now choose crosstool-ng (Latest) from git 
#
#  Installs a gcc cross compiler for compiling code for raspberry pi on OSX.
#  This script is based on several scripts and forum posts I've found around
#  the web, the most significant being: 
#
#  http://okertanov.github.com/2012/12/24/osx-crosstool-ng/
#  http://crosstool-ng.org/hg/crosstool-ng/file/715b711da3ab/docs/MacOS-X.txt
#  http://gnuarmeclipse.livius.net/wiki/Toolchain_installation_on_OS_X
#  http://elinux.org/RPi_Kernel_Compilation
#
#
#  And serveral articles that mostly dealt with the MentorGraphics tool, which I
#  I abandoned in favor of crosstool-ng
#
#  The process:
#  (1) Install HomeBrew and packages: gnu-sed binutils gawk automake libtool
#                                     bash grep wget xz help2man
#
#  (2) Download Homebrew to $BrewHome so as not to interfere with macports or fink
#
#  (3) Create a case sensitive volume using hdiutil and mount it to /Volumes/$Volume
#      The size of the volume grows as needed since it is of type SPARSE.
#      This also means that the filee of the mounted volume is $ImageName.sparseimage
#
#  (4) Download, patch and build crosstool-ng
#
#  (5) Configure and build the toolchain.
#
#  License:
#      Please feel free to use this in any way you see fit.

# If latest is 'y', then git will be used to download crosstool-ng LATEST

   This shell script is a front end to crosstool-ng to help build a cross compiler on your Mac.  It downloads all the necessary files to build the cross compiler.  It only assumes you have Xcode command line tools installed.

   Options:
      -i <ImageName> - Instead of CrosstoolNG.sparseImage use <ImageName>.sparseImageI
      -V <Volume>    - Instead of /Volumes/CrosstoolNG/ use /Volumes/<Volume>
      -c Brew        - Remove all installed Brew tools.
      -c ct-ng       - Run make clean in crosstool-ng path
      -c realClean   - Unmounts the image and removes it. This destroys EVERYTHING!
      -b             - Build the cross compiler AFTER building the necessary tools
                       and you have defined the crosstool-ng .config file.
      -t             - After the build, run a Hello World test on it.
      help           - This menu.
      "none"         - Go for it all if no options given. it will always try to 
                       continue where it left off
