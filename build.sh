#  Installs a gcc cross compiler for compiling code for raspberry pi on OSX.
#  This script is based on several scripts and forum posts I've found around
#  the web, the most significant being: 
#
#  http://okertanov.github.com/2012/12/24/osx-crosstool-ng/
#  http://crosstool-ng.org/hg/crosstool-ng/file/715b711da3ab/docs/MacOS-X.txt
#  http://gnuarmeclipse.livius.net/wiki/Toolchain_installation_on_OS_X
#  http://elinux.org/RPi_Kernel_Compilation
#
#
#  And serveral articles that mostly dealt with the MentorGraphics tool, which I
#  I abandoned in favor of crosstool-ng
#
#  The process:
#  (1) Install HomeBrew and packages: gnu-sed binutils gawk automake libtool
#                                     bash grep wget xz help2man
#
#  (2) Download Homebrew to $BrewHome so as not to interfere with macports or fink
#
#  (3) Create a case sensitive volume using hdiutil and mount it to /Volumes/$ImageName
#      The size of the volume grows as needed since it is of type SPARSE.
#      This also means that the filee of the mounted volume is $ImageName.sparseImage
#
#  (4) Download, patch and build crosstool-ng
#
#  (5) Configure and build the toolchain.
#
#  License:
#      Please feel free to use this in any way you see fit.

#

# This will be mounted as /Volumes/CrossToolNG
# The crosstool image will be $ImageName.sparseimage
# The volume will grow as required because of the SPARSE type

# This will be the name of the toolchain created by crosstools-ng
# It is placed in /Volumes/CrossToolNG

# This is where your ยง{ToolchainName".config file is if you have one.

   This shell script is a front end to crosstool-ng to help build a cross compiler on your Mac.  It downloads all the necessary files to build the cross compiler.  It only assumes you have Xcode command line tools installed.

   Options:
      cleanBrew      - Remove all installed Brew tools.
      ct-ngMakeClean - Run make clean in crosstool-ng path
      realClean      - Unmounts the image and removes it. This destroys EVERYTHING!
      continueBuild  - Build the cross compiler AFTER building the necessary tools
                       and you have defined the crosstool-ng .config file.
      help           - This menu.
